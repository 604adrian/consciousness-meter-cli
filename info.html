WHAT IS THIS AND WHERE AM I?
===========================

		This is a CONSCIOUSNESS METER. In the highly influetial book 'The Conscious Mind' by David Chalmers, a consciousness meter is defined as a hypothetical device that will measure whether or not an object is conscious. A consciousness meter is usually branded as some far-flug future technology, akin to self-driving cars, personal quantum computers, or printers that actually work.

    Luckily, this BASH script has managed to overcome these technological hurdles: it is a fully functioning BASH script. This BASH script is a consciousness meter. For any given object, it will tell you whether or not that object is conscious.

    How, you ask? How does a humble BASH script such as this manage to realize far-flung ideas about sci-fi technology with only a few lines of code? Easy. This consciousness script ONLY WORKS if one of two theories of consciousness is true: illusionism or panpsychism. Illusionism is the view that consciousness is an illusion; practically speaking it amounts to the view that consciousness does not exist. Panpsychism, on the other hand, is the view that everything is conscious (pan = all, psych = mind). As you might imagine, if either of these views are true, then the technological hurdles associated with devleoping a conscious meter are significantly reduced.

    So I leave you with a conditional statement: IF either illusionism or panpsychism is true, then this BASH script represents a great leap forward for humanities technological capabilities. Because for the first time in human history we have (freely available on GitHub) a fully functioning consciousness meter.


ILLUSIONIST MODE
================



PANPSYCHIST MODE
================

        PANPSYCHISM is the philosophical world view that everything is conscious (yes, everything). The consciousness meter presented here is strictly panpsychist (meaning that it only works if panpsychism is true).


        But there is no need for this to be the case, because if panpsychism is true, then descrning what is or isn't consciousness shouldn't be hard (because we already know what objects are conscious: all of them), so making a Consciousness Meter shouldn't be hard either. And that, ladies and gentlemen, is what I have done here, with this humble bash script.

        This leads us to the conditional statement that if panpsychism is true hen this BASH script is a great technological innovation: it is the very first consciosuness meter. The much anticipated technology is finally here.
